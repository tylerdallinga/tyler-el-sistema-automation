El Sistema Web-app
Requirements

Home:

User Interface:
Should be neat and easily accessible by the user with no boxes boxes interfering with others.
User Interface bugs:
When successfully loaded to the home page if you scroll the page up the “El Sistema” logo will cover part of the first picture and not be in the actual Header
? I’m not sure if this is a bug, the two white boxes in the middle of the page cover up part of the pictures they are next to. Like I said not sure if this is a bug or if the spacing is off.
? Like the previous bug entered not sure if this an actual function of the home screen but two blue boxes, titled Registration and Vision do not scroll with the screen but remain on the page for a bit while scrolling down the page.  
Navigation: 
Should be able to navigate to different screens by clicking the different tabs in the top of the app as well as the bottom of the app on the “Navigation” section. 
Throughout the home page are also are buttons that should navigate you to diffrent pages in the web app including the “Contact Us” box
Enter your phone number in the “STAY CONNECTED” field and receive a text notification that your signed up was successful.   
Navigation Bugs:
When navigating between the home page (or any page really) when you click the back button the icon says you're still in the previous page. For example, starting from the home page navigate to the “Calendar” page then click the back back button in the browser. It will then navigate you back to the home screen but the calendar icon is still highlighted saying your in calendar when in fact you're in the home screen. 
When navigating between the home page (or any page really) when have also scrolled down the page you are on when you click another tab from the top to take you to a new section of the web app the screen that loads doesn't take you to the top of that page, it however will take you to ether the bottom or the middle of that page depending how far you have scrolled down previously.
 Almost identical to the previously mentioned bug when you click the links in “navigation” section of the bottom of the app the next screen does not load you all the way to the top of the page.
The Contact Us Box should pull up either a page or contact information to “contact” them however when clicked nothing happens.
